# hello-world
from the GitHub Tutorial

Hi! I'm Karen
I'm a biotech engineer trying to learn more about programming languages to use them on research. I would like to learn more about machine learning before getting into a computer neuroscience phd program.

This is just part of the github tutorial.

I'm shy.
